So, I was developing a new budget feature for Monitor for EnergyHive and Engage and needed a way to display the data without obstructing the current user interface. 

I am going to do a complete redesign of the app sometime soon, but for now, this is how it looks:

![device-monitor-current.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/device-monitor-current.png){: .screenshot}

Obviously the design I have used doesn't leave much space for extra features. I seriously need a better UI designer.
